<b> Halloween Event Marketing Campaign</b>

This Halloween Campaign was created for a Small B2C Events company, hosting a unique haunted house adventure occurring October 30th, 31st and November 1st 2020.The strategy was;
-	Set clear expectations regarding the customer experience during the event.
-	Write a compelling narrative that creates interest by pulling the reader into the storyline.
-	Product positioning, highlighting the unique aspects to differentiate the event in comparison to competing Halloween events such as PNE’s Fright Nights. 

The posts were scheduled in advance via the Hootsuite publisher function. Posting times, for each day, were set based on the time of day when engagement is highest on each platform. For Instagram the times vary. The Instagram posts were set up at the below optimal time of day.

For Facebook, the window for B2C is between 9-10am, 12-1pm and 4-5pm daily. Originally we elected for posts at 5pm; however, after reviewing the engagement stats from the first week of the campaign, I altered the Facebook schedule to post between 11am and 12pm.

After completion of a basic website structure check, drag test, SEO score assessment, and market research I created the following Buyer Persona and SWOT Analysis;
